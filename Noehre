Clayton Noehre

Durring the summer I did several major things. 
First would be the online class that I took this was something thattook a decent portion of time. 
Other than this I visited several friends and We went out to see people. 
Along with this I got into several video games and enjoyed the time I had playing with them. 
Once it started getting closer to the school year, I ended up going to Kings Island with my family as going away time with my brother.
As he is heading off to his first year of college in Colorado.
